            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              ShopNest was founded in 2020 with a simple mission: to bring beautiful, functional design into every home. What began as a small curated collection of handpicked items has grown into a comprehensive home goods destination, but our core values remain unchanged.
            </p>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-6 leading-relaxed">
              We believe that thoughtfully designed spaces enhance our everyday experiences. Whether it's the perfect lamp that creates just the right ambiance, a comfortable sofa that brings the family together, or a unique decorative piece that sparks joy, we understand that these items are more than just objectsâ€”they're the building blocks of a home.
